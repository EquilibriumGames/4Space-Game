# Ebon-Universe
Ebon Universe is a 3D space game, built for multiplayer and creativity. As a player you will start at a small, remote, habitable planet around a calm star. You will be able to gather resources and build a ship to your liking to explore further into the galaxy. Each planet is around 20 kilometres in diameter, with a high density, we are doing this to allow for fast exploration and to avoid a overwhelmed feeling that a realistic sized planet would create. Each galaxy, created on the client or server, would be special and would contain ~25,000 stars, but with over ~250,000 planets and as many moons!  As you make friends in the game you can add them to your ingame friends list, and use an imported list from Steam. You will be able to share waypoints with them to your current, or past, locations. We are aiming to make this game run on about any computer made in the past 7 years, we hope our minimum OpenGL version will stay at 3.0, but this is just an idea.
